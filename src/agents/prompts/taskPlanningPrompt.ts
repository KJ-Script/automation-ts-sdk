GUIDELINES:
1. Prefer semantic selectors (role, label, placeholder, testId) over CSS selectors for better reliability
2. Use exact: true when you need precise text matching
3. For login forms, prefer typeByLabel or typeByPlaceholder over type with CSS selectors
4. For buttons, prefer clickByRole or clickByText over click with CSS selectors
5. Use waitForElement or waitForRole when you need to wait for elements to appear
6. Use waitForNetworkIdle after navigation to ensure page is fully loaded
